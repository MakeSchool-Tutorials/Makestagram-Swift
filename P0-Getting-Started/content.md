Throughout this tutorial you will build a photo sharing app that is similar to the popular app  [Instagram](https://instagram.com/). After finishing the *Make School Notes* tutorial you should have a good understanding of the basics of iOS development.

In this tutorial we will touch many advanced iOS development topics, including how to use [Parse](https://parse.com) to build a backend for your app.

Here are the most important things you will learn throughout this tutorial:

- How to define a data model using Parse
- How to implement a login using Parse and Facebook
- How to capture photos and upload them to Parse
- How to perform work in the background to keep your user interface responsive
- How to build complex Parse queries
- How to structure a complex iOS app
- How to use libraries built by other developers to speed up development

After finishing the tutorial you will have a good understanding of building complex iOS apps that tie into a backend - from there you will be able to move on and create your original iPhone App!

Here's a video that will give you a brief overview of what you will be learning:
