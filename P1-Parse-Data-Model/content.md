To build a photo sharing app we will need to exchange information between multiple users on multiple devices.

In the *Make School Notes* tutorial we built an app that only stores information locally, on the user's phone. There is no way of sharing information with other users or accessing notes from other devices. This is fine for some apps. However, most applications need to provide a way for multiple users to to interact with each other. In such cases we need to store the information used in the app on a server that is accessible by all users.

#What does Parse do for us?

Until recently it was necessary to write an entire server application to handle this - now we can use the Parse platform instead. Parse allows us to define the different type of objects we want to store for our application, as well as relationships between them. Additionally Parse provides an iOS library that makes it easy to store and read objects on and from our Parse backend.

We will start off by creating a Parse account and adding a new app to it.
