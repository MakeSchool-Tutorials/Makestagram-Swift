Time for some coding! Setting up the Xcode project for Makestagram would take a decent amount of time. We would need to add the Facebook and ParseSDKs and add a bunch of other system frameworks that these SDKs need.

Instead of going through these steps now, we will start with a template project that has all the required libraries set up. That way we can start coding right away. Once you have completed the entire *Makestagram* tutorial, you will have access to a separate tutorial that will teach you how to set up your Xcode project that uses Facebook and Parse from scratch.
