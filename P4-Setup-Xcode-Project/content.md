Time for some coding! Setting up the Xcode project for Makestagram would take a decent amount of time. We would need to add the Facebook and ParseSDKs and add a bunch of other system frameworks that these SDKs need.

Instead of going through these steps now, we will start with a template project that has all the required libraries set up. That way we can start coding right away. Once you have completed the entire *Makestagram* tutorial, you will have access to a separate tutorial that will teach you how to set up your Xcode project that uses Facebook and Parse from scratch.

Get started by downloading our [Starter Project](https://github.com/MakeSchool/Makestagram-Swift-Solution/archive/StarterProject.zip).
Once the download completes, unzip the project. Copy the project to a folder where you typically store your coding projects. Then open the Xcode project.

As discussed earlier, this project contains all the frameworks we need. Additionally it contains a few source code files that we will use later as we progress through the tutorial.

We're now ready to dive into the first step - writing code to connect our App to our Parse backend.
